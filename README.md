# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation: I can bypass the login by using another browser session ID, which can lead to steal users information.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi) => The blue color site has one place where the input is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration => It can perform if web application gives hints whether user exists or not.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) => The red color site is missing code which would prevent some sensitive information from being made public.

GIF Walkthrough:

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) => the red color site does not have CSRF protections on the admin area. A smart hacker could design a form which would automatically submit form data to the staff area and take advantage of a logged in user's access permissions.

## Notes

I had some challenges doing the lab 8, especially from challenge 6 to 9.
